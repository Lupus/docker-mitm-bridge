# xDS Service Excessive Logging Issue - Investigation Report

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Severity:** Critical - Disk space exhaustion
**Status:** Fixed in code, requires rebuild and Kubernetes configuration update

---

## Problem Summary

The xDS service container was generating excessive logs that consumed over 160GB of disk space, leading to disk space exhaustion on the host system. The Docker daemon log rotation settings (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) did not apply to these logs because they were written to Kubernetes volume mounts, not through Docker's logging driver.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Being Logged

The xDS service uses Go's standard `log` package which logs to stderr. The following log statements were dumping **entire protobuf request structures** containing the complete Envoy configuration:

**File:** `main.go`

1. **Line 269** (SDS - Secret Discovery Service):
   ```go
   log.Printf("Received SDS request: %+v", req)
   ```

2. **Line 338** (SDS FetchSecrets):
   ```go
   log.Printf("FetchSecrets called with request: %+v", req)
   ```

3. **Line 1026** (LDS - Listener Discovery Service):
   ```go
   log.Printf("Received LDS request: %+v", req)
   ```

4. **Line 1051** (LDS FetchListeners):
   ```go
   log.Printf("FetchListeners called with request: %+v", req)
   ```

5. **Line 1226** (CDS - Cluster Discovery Service):
   ```go
   log.Printf("Received CDS request: %+v", req)
   ```

6. **Line 1255** (CDS FetchClusters):
   ```go
   log.Printf("FetchClusters called with request: %+v", req)
   ```

### Why This Was Problematic

1. **Frequency**: Envoy polls xDS endpoints frequently (every few seconds) to check for configuration updates
2. **Size**: Each protobuf request structure contained:
   - Complete cluster configurations (ext_authz, dynamic_forward_proxy)
   - Complete listener configurations with filter chains for all domains
   - TLS certificate metadata
   - All Envoy extensions and capabilities
3. **Volume**: Each log entry was **hundreds of kilobytes** due to the `%+v` format printing the entire nested structure
4. **Accumulation**: 160GB+ of logs accumulated over 24 hours

### Log Volume Breakdown

```
Location: /var/lib/docker/volumes/d64f369d19c1bd6cf135b9f91a79d992d53ca2aaa37494e312b13591a384d15f/_data/log/pods/envoy-test_envoy-test_c7dc27d8-caa9-43a0-83a0-12c7e5ce838b/xds-service/

Initial state (before cleanup):
- 6.log.20251012-115813:    102.7 GiB
- 6.log:                     53.0 GiB
- 6.log.20251012-112759.gz:   4.2 GiB
- 6.log.20251012-111735.gz:   1.5 GiB
Total:                       ~161 GiB

After cleanup (still growing):
- 7.log:                      11 GiB (within 3 hours)
```

### Why Docker Log Rotation Didn't Work

The Docker daemon configuration in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

**Only applies to:**
- Container stdout/stderr logs stored in `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>/<container-id>-json.log`

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Logs written to Kubernetes volume mounts at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/*/log/pods/`
- Files written inside mounted volumes

The xDS service logs go through:
1. Container stderr →
2. Kubernetes CRI (containerd) →
3. Kubernetes pod log directory →
4. Docker volume mount

This path **bypasses** Docker's logging driver entirely.

## The Fix

### Code Changes (Applied)

Changed verbose logging to concise, metadata-only logging:

**Before:**
```go
log.Printf("Received SDS request: %+v", req)
```

**After:**
```go
log.Printf("Received SDS request for %d resources (version: %s, nonce: %s)",
    len(req.ResourceNames), req.VersionInfo, req.ResponseNonce)
```

This change was applied to all 6 problematic log statements, reducing log output from **hundreds of KB per request** to **~100 bytes per request** (99.9%+ reduction).

### Files Modified

- `main.go` (lines 269, 338-340, 1026, 1054-1055, 1226, 1256-1257)

### Deployment Status

- ✅ Code changes committed
- ⚠️ Binary built locally (`xds-service` compiled)
- ❌ Pod needs to be redeployed with fixed binary
- ❌ Kubernetes log rotation not configured

---

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Immediate: Redeploy xDS Service

#### Option A: Rebuild Docker Image and Load into kind

```bash
cd /home/kolkhovskiy/git/docker-mitm-bridge/cilium-tls-poc/xds-service

# Build the image (requires network access for go mod download)
docker build -t xds-service:test .

# Load into kind cluster
kind load docker-image xds-service:test --name kyverno-test

# Recreate pod with updated image
kubectl apply -f <pod-definition.yaml>
```

#### Option B: Direct Binary Replacement (Quick Fix)

The compiled binary is already available at:
```
/home/kolkhovskiy/git/docker-mitm-bridge/cilium-tls-poc/xds-service/xds-service
```

Since the pod was deleted, find and reapply the pod definition to create it with the fixed code.

### 2. Long-term: Configure Kubernetes Log Rotation

Configure kubelet log rotation parameters to prevent log accumulation regardless of application logging behavior.

#### kind Cluster Configuration

Create or update your kind cluster configuration file:

```yaml
# kind-config.yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: KubeletConfiguration
    apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    # Maximum size of container log file before rotation
    # Logs will rotate when they reach this size
    containerLogMaxSize: 50Mi

    # Maximum number of rotated log files to keep per container
    # Older files are deleted when this limit is exceeded
    containerLogMaxFiles: 3

    # Optional: Advanced tuning for high-volume logging
    # Maximum number of concurrent log rotation workers
    containerLogMaxWorkers: 2

    # Optional: How often to check for log rotation (default 10s)
    # containerLogMonitorInterval: 10s
```

#### Applying to Existing kind Cluster

**Note:** Kubelet configuration cannot be changed on a running cluster. You must recreate the cluster:

```bash
# Export cluster name
CLUSTER_NAME=kyverno-test

# Delete existing cluster
kind delete cluster --name $CLUSTER_NAME

# Create cluster with new config
kind create cluster --name $CLUSTER_NAME --config kind-config.yaml

# Redeploy your applications
```

#### Recommended Values

| Parameter | Default | Recommended | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `containerLogMaxSize` | 10Mi | 50Mi-100Mi | Balance between `kubectl logs` usability and disk usage |
| `containerLogMaxFiles` | 5 | 3 | Limit historical logs, reduce disk usage |
| `containerLogMaxWorkers` | 1 | 2 | Handle rotation for multiple high-volume containers |

**Important Notes:**

1. **kubectl logs limitation**: Only the **latest log file** is available via `kubectl logs`. If your log size is 50Mi, you'll only see the most recent 50Mi when running `kubectl logs`.

2. **File count calculation**: With 50Mi size and 3 files, maximum disk usage per container is:
   - Current log: 50Mi (being written)
   - Rotated logs: 3 × 50Mi = 150Mi
   - **Total per container: ~200Mi maximum**

3. **Pod with 4 containers** (like envoy-test):
   - 4 containers × 200Mi = **800Mi maximum** per pod

4. **Rotation triggers**:
   - Size-based: When log file reaches `containerLogMaxSize`
   - Automatic: Kubelet monitors every `containerLogMonitorInterval` (default 10s)
   - On restart: Pod/container restarts create new log files

### 3. Additional Best Practices

#### Application-Level Logging

Consider adding log level control to the xDS service:

```go
// Add environment variable for log level
logLevel := os.Getenv("LOG_LEVEL")
if logLevel == "" {
    logLevel = "info"
}

// Use structured logging library (e.g., zap, logrus)
// Only log detailed xDS requests when LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### Monitoring

Set up alerts for:
- Disk usage on kind cluster nodes (>70% warning, >85% critical)
- Container log directory size
- Log rotation events

```bash
# Check current log sizes
docker exec kyverno-test-control-plane \
  du -sh /var/log/pods/envoy-test_*/*/

# Monitor in real-time
watch -n 5 'docker exec kyverno-test-control-plane \
  du -sh /var/log/pods/envoy-test_*/*/'
```

#### Cleanup Script

For existing clusters without log rotation configured:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup-logs.sh

CLUSTER_NODE="kyverno-test-control-plane"
NAMESPACE="envoy-test"
POD_NAME="envoy-test"

# Get pod UID
POD_UID=$(docker exec $CLUSTER_NODE kubectl get pod $POD_NAME -n $NAMESPACE \
  -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}')

# Cleanup old logs
docker exec $CLUSTER_NODE sh -c "
  cd /var/log/pods/${NAMESPACE}_${POD_NAME}_${POD_UID}/xds-service && \
  rm -f *.gz *.tmp *-[0-9]* && \
  truncate -s 0 *.log
"

echo "Logs cleaned for pod $POD_NAME in namespace $NAMESPACE"
```

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter issues with:
- **Docker build failures**: Check network connectivity and DNS resolution
- **kind cluster recreation**: Ensure all resources are exported/backed up first
- **Log rotation not working**: Verify kubelet configuration with `docker exec kyverno-test-control-plane crictl info | grep -A 20 containerLogMaxSize`
- **Pod deployment**: Check for pod definition YAML files in the repository
